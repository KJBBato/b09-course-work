Assignment 4: Sockets
========
File copy (similar to Unix/Linux cp) using sockets. This implementation is unidirectional, 
the files from the client is copied into the server and either adds to server or updates the 
modified files and directory. 

Note: This implementation does not delete from server (i.e. deleting a file from the client
file system will not result in deletion of a file in the server)
